## Step One: Installing Virtual Studio Code On Your Device

(Skip this step if you already have VScode on your device or you are planning to use lab computers, with the application pre-installed.)

To install VScode visit [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com) and click the big blue Download button on the top right of the page. Follow the step provided and down a version of VScode suitable for your operating system.

After running through all the steps and installing the application, open up the VSCode application and you should have a window that looks similar to this image below.(The window you opened up might have a different color or formatting but that is due to the version you downloaded or was changed due to personal preference.)
